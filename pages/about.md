# Paper Beats Rock DMC: A History

The PBR:DMC opened in June 2018 led by founder and director Theophilus Moss. The inspiration to start the center came from his own experiences at the Johns Hopkins Digital Media Center and collaborative work he did while attending university.

"People, students especially, have an amazing ability for creation when given a common goal, the right tools and guidance, and time to work together. The center is meant to be a place where they have all three. I believe in young Bahamians and want to give them more power to have an impact on the world around them and technology is a great way to do that."

Mission: To promote and facilitate the use of creative technology and prepare life-long learners to confidently master new skills through active engagement and hands-on learning.

Vision: To build a culture of creation, creativity, and collaboration throughout the Bahamas.

The DMC is the flagship project of the Paper Beats Rock Collection, a growing collection of works that span art, politics, information, and education.
