# The Paper Beats Rock Collection

>
"Someone once told me that smart people build things. That was really comforting to me because I didn't have to figure out if I was smart, I just needed to see if I could build something - and I did."

Paper Beats Rock is a growing collection of works that span art, politics, information, and education. It was started by Theophilus Moss to expand the universe of high-quality Bahamian-focused websites. Creation and creativity are at the core of what the collection stands for.

Everything an individual needs to create great websites, including tutorials, is available online for free. The only things you need are content and motivation!

## [The Paper Beats Rock Digital Media Center][1]
> The flagship project of the collection and the site you're on! Feel free to explore what's currently being planned for the center's opening in 2018.

## [Bahamas Knowledge Revolution][2] 
> Launched around the same time as the digital media center. It's a knowledgebase for Bahamian politics and some of the country's most important statistics.

## The Compass Points East
> The first planned webcomic of the collection. The story follows three children as they encounter the unknown on their little island where all is not as it seems. The first story arc is storyboarded but we're looking for a talented artist to work with! Please reach out if interested.

## [Bahamas Nonprofits][3]
> A quick page for the collection showing the active nonprofit organizations around the Bahamas.

## [Personal blog][4]
> One Bahamian shouting into the void. I mostly cover starting and running a business in the Bahamas. (Or will in 2018 when I start)
