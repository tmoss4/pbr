# The Paper Beats Rock Collection

>
"Someone once told me that smart people build things. That was really comforting to me because I didn't have to figure out if I was smart, I just needed to see if I could build something - and I did."

Paper Beats Rock is a growing collection of works that span art, politics, information, and education. It was started by Theophilus Moss to expand the universe of high-quality Bahamian-focused websites. Creation and creativity are at the core of what the collection stands for.

Everything an individual needs to create great websites, including tutorials, is available online for free. The only things you need are content and motivation. 

[The Paper Beats Rock: Digital Media Center][1] is the flagship project of the collection. Feel free to explore the website.

[Bahamas Knowledge Revolution][2] was launched around the same time. It's an information warehouse for some of Bahamas' most pressing concerns.

[The Compass Points East][3] is the first webcomic of the collection and it follows three children as they encounter the unknown on their little island. All is not as it seems.

Most / Least importantly, is my [blog][4]. One Bahamian shouting into the void where I'll talk about life in the Bahamas and trying to do something you enjoy.
